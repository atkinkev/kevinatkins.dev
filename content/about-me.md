## Hi, I'm Kevin!

I'm a full stack software developer with extensive experience designing accounting solutions for local governments and utilities. I have over six years of professional development experience and a lifelong love for tinkering and learning about tech.

## Hobbies and Interests

Outside of my work life, I enjoy exploring Michigan's Upper Peninsula and cooking delicious healthy food for my family. I'm an avid mountain biker and skier and love to experience what every season has to offer.
